<p>Thanks for your interest in Light Camp; we hope you are enjoying the website and have found some lovely new campsites to visit!</p>
<p>The event starts on Friday-evening and last the whole weekend. The event takes place on camping Valkenhof in Westerbork</p>
<p>Before the event takes place people can visit a website. On this website they can find information about the event and it should be possible to make a reservation.</p>
<p>The entrance price for the event is 35 euro. In the future the participant gets an arm brace with an RFID-chip, containing the unique identity number. This arm brace will be used at the entrance to check if the participant is allowed to enter the event. During the event the participant can use the arm brace to pay for food or drinks, etc.  every participant gets its unique identity number by e-mail.</p>
<p>A group of participants can book a camping spot by choosing a free spot on the map of the camping. Every spot can be booked for at most 6 persons.</p>
<p>To make a reservation for a camping spot you should specify all participants and specify which one of them will get the bill. You can only make a reservation for the whole weekend; not for a single day. The price for a reservation for a camping spot is 30 euro plus 20 euro for every guest.</p>
<p>When a visitor leaves the event it must be possible to check the balance of its event-account. The fellow worker can return the money to the visitor and mark this event-account as not valid anymore. Do not forget to check if the visitor has hired some material but forgot to return it. </p>
